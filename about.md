This is a collaborative learning journal created by two siblings to document our learning journey. We use this space to:

1. Record our daily learning
2. Ask and answer questions
3. Track our progress over time
4. Share knowledge with each other

## How It Works

Each day, we add entries about what we've learned. Posts are organized chronologically and by author. We can also track open questions that arise during our learning process.
