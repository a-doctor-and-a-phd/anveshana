Mehendi, also known as henna or மருதாணி, works by staining the skin with a natural dye called **lawsone**, which comes from henna plant, that binds to the keratin in the skin's outer layer, creating a temporary, reddish-brown stain.

## Etymology:
The origin of "mehendi" is from the Sanskrit word "mendhika," which refers to the henna plant that releases a red dye.

## The Source:
Henna (or mehendi) is derived from the leaves of the Lawsonia inermis plant, also known as the henna tree.

## The Dye:
The leaves contain a natural dye called lawsone, which is responsible for the reddish-brown colour.

Likely due to the desire for a "tattoo-black" appearance, some people add the synthetic dye p-phenylenediamine (PPD) to henna to give it a black colour. PPD may cause moderate to severe allergic reactions when applied to skin.

## The Process:
- The henna paste, made from dried and ground henna leaves mixed with water and other ingredients, is applied to the skin in designs. 
- Henna requires a slightly acidic pH in order to draw out the lawsone molecule, so using an acidic mixer like lemon juice helps give the paste a strong foundation for dye release.
- The lawsone molecules in the paste bind to the keratin proteins in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). 
- The stain initially appears as a bright orange, but darkens over the next 24-72 hours through a process called oxidation, resulting in a reddish-brown color. 
- The stain fades gradually as the outer layer of skin sheds naturally, typically lasting for a few days to a couple of weeks.

## Factors Affecting Stain:
The final color and longevity of the stain depend on factors like the quality of the henna paste, the length of time the paste is left on, and the type of skin.

## Traditional Use:
Mehndi is a ceremonial art form common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. It is typically applied during weddings for Sikh, Muslim and Hindu brides. In Rajasthan, the grooms are given designs that are often as elaborate as those for brides. In Assam, apart from marriage, it is broadly used by unmarried women during Rongali Bihu.

Among South Asian Muslims, mehndi is a common tradition for brides as well as other girls on weddings. It is also done for Eid on Chaand Raat. There are professionals as well for this while other people do this by their own.
