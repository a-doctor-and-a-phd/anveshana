## What is Quicksand?
  Quicksand typically contains a mixture of fine sand, silt and clay grains saturated with water. It is a non-Newtonian fluid (its viscosity and flow properties change depending on the florces applied to it). It is a saturated, loose sand that loses its supporting capacity and acts like a liquid when agitated. When a person steps in quicksand, the water gets squeezed out creating a vacuum that sucks the person or animal into it. The more the person struggles, the more the grains are displaced, thus reducing friction and hence causing the person to sink deeper.

## Where to find Quicksand?
1. Rivers and shorelines
2. Coastal areas
3. Deserts
4. Marshes and swamps

## Can you sink to death?
  Humans are not as dense as quicksand, hence we will only ever sink halfway. Quicksand has a density of about 2 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas the density of the human body is only about 1 gram per cubic centimeter. At that level of density, sinking beyond about waist height in quicksand is impossible. 

## How to get out of a Quicksand?
  To move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to liquefy it. The forces required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of 1 cm/s would require the same amount of force as that needed to lift a car. Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to increase viscosity of the fluid, and rotation of the body so as to float in the supine position (lying horizontally with the face and torso facing up).

The bottom line? Quicksands are not as they are depicted in the movies. Yes, you can get stuck in one but they are not impossible to get out of!
